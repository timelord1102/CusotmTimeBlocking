# Custom Time Blocking
A study tool based on the Pomodoro technique with my own custom changes

## What is 'Time Blocking'
Time blocking is a form of work timer in which for every X minutes of work you get N minutes of break

## Pomodoro vs Mine
<p>The Pomodoro technique is a form of time blocking that tends to go a little like this: </p>

``
25 minutes work, 5 minutes for with a 15 mintes break every 4 cycles
``

<p>Mine follows a different pattern with checning break times. I found this seemed to help me work for more with my ADHD. <br>  
Below is the time blocking used in my code. Blocks are in minutes, alternating between work and break:</p>

``
blocks = [25, 5, 25, 5, 25, 5, 25, 15, 25, 5, 25, 30, 25, 5, 25, 15]
``
